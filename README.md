All data used was given in the 2025 NFL big data bowl project.

The Blitzes.R file was used to gather data on the effectivness of disguising blitzes, and a table can be seen in success percentage given difference in blitzers. 
A play is marked as successful for the defense if they do not give up 40% of yards needed on first down, 60% of yards needed on second down, or 100% of yards needed on third or fourth down.
The difference is the number of players showing blitz minus the number of people who actually rushed the passer. If this is negative, more players showed blitz than actually rushed and it was a disguesed blitz. 

The Blitz_graph.R file can be used to plot the positions of defensive players prior to the snap. Players within the drawn box were classified as a potential rusher. The 2022 week 1 Broncos 2Q 6/34 pdf shows the positions of Seahawks players on that play.
